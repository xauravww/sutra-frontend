/**
 * "Skip to main content" link — WCAG 2.1 SC 2.4.1 (Bypass Blocks), bug #1600.
 *
 * Rendered as the very first focusable element in the document (root layout,
 * ahead of all header/navigation chrome), so the first Tab press lands on it
 * and a keyboard or screen-reader user can jump straight into the page's
 * `<main id="main-content">` instead of tabbing through the whole nav.
 *
 * Visually hidden until focused, then shown as a floating pill at the top-left
 * so a sighted keyboard user can see where focus went.
